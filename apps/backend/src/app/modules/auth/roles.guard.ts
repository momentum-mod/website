    // Note that we're not storing this on the JWT. We *could* encode roles and
    // bans using bitflags and store easily, but then you have the standard
    // stateless/JWT problem of not being to invalidate tokens when a role is
    // updated. This is particularly nasty for the case of a user's bans being
    // updated - a user could be issued a JWT with no bans, get banned from,
    // say, run submission, yet would still hold a JWT with no bans until it
    // expires. So, we can't trust a JWT alone to tell us a user is not banned
    // from performing some action.
    //
    // In our case, since most endpoints are *not* role or ban dependent, it's
    // easiest to handle RBAC using (still relatively cheap) DB calls.

    // If you're not familiar with bit flags, they're just a bunch of booleans
    // encoded into a single integer. Always think of them in terms of binary
    // numbers, not decimal! Let's say the allowed roles are 0100 and 1000 (
    // so joined together as 1100). The user's roles are some combination of
    // flags (or none, in which case just 0000). By ANDing the allowed roles
    // with the actual roles, we see if any 1s line up, and if so, the resultant
    // value will be non-zero.
    //
    // E.g. if user roles are 0001 we have
    //   1100
    // & 0001 (if top and bottom place are 1, resultant place is 1, otherwise 0)
    // = 0000 = 0 (fail)
    //
    // For 0101:
    //   0101
    // & 1100
    // = 0100 != 0 (pass)
    //
    // This method saves making an SQL table full of booleans, and is easy to
    // work with once you get the general concept. Remember, rows of binary
    // digits, not decimals!
