          This section lets you pick the final leaderboards for the map. You should only be using this if you are a experienced in the main
          mode(s) of the current map. If you don't know what you're doing, ask in Discord, or leave this to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most maps are submitted with an single intended gamemode in mind, and will <i> usually</i> be ranked in that mode, unless the
          gameplay seems to be of very low quality. If that's the case and the submitter requested it be ranked, it may be worth leaving
          some suggestions in a review, and keeping it in submission for a bit longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          For non-intended modes, if you/others tried it on in that mode and it played reasonably well, usually give it an unranked
          leaderboard. Remember, unranked leaderboards don't provide rank points, but they do appear in the map selector for that mode, so
          don't give it a leaderboard if it's silly/gimmicky in that mode (e.g. don't rank a surf map in SJ just because someone airpogoed
          the entire thing). In the future we'll have "hidden/secret" leaderboards for if people genuinely want to compete in a weird
          off-mode, and a hidden leaderboard can always be switched to unranked in the future.
