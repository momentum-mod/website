          This section lets you pick the final leaderboards for the map. You should only be using this if you are experienced in the main
          mode(s) of the current map. If you don't know what you're doing, ask in Discord, or leave this to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most maps are submitted with a single intended gamemode in mind, and will usually become <b>ranked</b> in that mode, should the
          resulting gameplay be of high enough quality. If the map was requested to be ranked by the submitter, it may be worth keeping it
          in submission for a bit longer and leaving some suggestions in a review.
        </p>
        <p>
          For non-intended modes; if you and/or others tried a mode and it played reasonably well, you can give it an unranked leaderboard.
          Remember that unranked leaderboards don't provide rank points, but they do appear in the map selector for that mode. Don't add a
          leaderboard if it's only for gimmicks in that mode (e.g. don't rank a surf map in SJ just because someone airpogoed the entire
          thing). In the future we'll have "hidden/secret" leaderboards for if people genuinely want to compete in a weird off-mode, and a
          hidden leaderboard can always be switched to unranked in the future.
