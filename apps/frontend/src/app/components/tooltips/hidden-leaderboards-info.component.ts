        Hidden leaderboards are leaderboards for gamemodes that the map is not
        supposed to be played on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases the track will not even be possible to complete, but in
        some cases players may find it fun to compete on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like unranked leaderboards these don't grant ranked points. They also
        don't show up in the in-game map selector, and to play them you need to
        launch the map with your gamemode overriden!
