> *Momentum Mod is a standalone game built on the Source Engine, aiming to centralize movement gametypes found in CS:S, CS:GO, and TF2.*

This is the repository for the main Momentum Mod website, which acts as the central hub for and an extension to the [game client](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game). 

The frontend of Momentum's main site acts as the extension to the game, allowing players to log in via Steam (via OpenID), where they can find a dashboard that shows statistics, maps, players, and runs. The frontend runs on [Angular](https://angular.io) and utilizes the [Nebular](https://github.com/akveo/nebular) framework. More info about it and instructions to run it can be found in the [client/](client/) folder.

The backend of the website is the core of the interactive functionality of the game and handles things like map uploads/downloads, run submission/viewing, and stats congregation/filtering. The backend runs on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and utilizes the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. More info about it and instructions to run it can be found in the [server/](server/) folder.
