/* eslint @typescript-eslint/naming-convention: 0 */
/**
 * Enum of all possible tags.
 *
 * Tags should *never* be removed - if we need to disable a tag in the
 * future, just remove it global tags and gamemode tags.
 *
 * Breaking naming convention, using casing that lets us translate to English
 * strings easily.
 *
 * - If tag name starts with a number, prefix it with `_Num`.
 * - If tag name contains a hyphen, use `__`
 *
 * For example, `_Num2__Way_Sym` becomes `2-Way Sym`.
 *
 * After adding tags, you need to run
 * ```
 * nx run scripts:maptags-poeditor
 * ```
 * which writes a JSON file to cwd, then import that file into POEditor, with
 * "Also import translations to a language" set to English. POEditor will not
 * overwrite existing translations.
